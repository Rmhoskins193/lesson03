          <h2>Product Support & Amateur Designer</h2>

          <p>I come from a background of very different jobs ranging from guest services supervisor at a hotel to a technical support agent for a video game company. 
            I have a diverse set of interests ranging from finances, design, photography, and web development.
            Each role and interest has helped me in realizing what I love to do, what I have to offer, and what I need to achieve in order to accomplish my goals.

            <h3>Dog Treats Packaging</h3>
            <p>Tasked with creating a packaging design concept for a fictional dog treat, I was involved in every phase of the 
              project from initial designing to creating final deliverables of the package mockup. The fictional client requested a package in which
              dog treats would be stored and sold with the request that it has a "Summer Vacation" theme to it and clearly provide specific information.

            <h3>Convention Branding</h3>
            <p>Crafting a logo representing a "Think Big" convention. In order to ensure a quality product, I researched into the target audience
              and related demographics to create a logo that would appeal to them and the still portray the convention effectively. Adobe Illustrator was used to create 
              final deliverables for the client.

            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>Capturing moments organically using photography best practices. Tasked with using a camera to collect natural and organic moments found in everyday life, I used my camera to 
              take pictures, process images accordingly using Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop, and put a collection together. I have experience with street photography, product photography, as 
              well as portrait photography. All images are processed to ensure best lighting and quality without sacrificing the underlying picture original state, if possible.
