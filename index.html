          <h2>Product Support & Amateur Designer</h2>

          <p>I come from a background of very different jobs ranging from guest services supervisor at a hotel to a technical support agent for a video game company. 
            I have a diverse set of interests ranging from finances, design, photography, and web development.
            Each role and interest has helped me in realizing what I love to do, what I have to offer, and what I need to achieve in order to accomplish my goals.

            <h3>Dog Treats Packaging</h3>
            <img src="dogtreatpackage.png" alt="mockup of dog treats package showing a dog with sunglasses and tongue sticking out">
            <p>Tasked with creating a packaging design concept for a fictional dog treat, I was involved in every phase of the 
              project from initial designing to creating final deliverables of the package mockup. The fictional client requested a package in which
              dog treats would be stored and sold with the request that it has a "Summer Vacation" theme to it and clearly provide specific information.

            <p>Crafting a logo representing a "Think Big" convention. In order to ensure a quality product, I researched into the target audience
              and related demographics to create a logo that would appeal to them and the still portray the convention effectively. Adobe Illustrator was used to create 
              final deliverables for the client.
